# Project920
Live class discussion grading
This project was for IB HL Computer Science and my very first big project. The entire project was made as a web app for a client which we had to procure for the project. We had feedback and were given instructions on documenting the process of learning and building the project. I had to learn JS/JQuery and generic web for this project.
